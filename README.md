# Universal Quantum Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project aims at ultilizing Machine Learning techniques such as Reinforcement Learning to discover the optimal universal quantum control methods. The project will be likely to be operated on the HiQ platform, Huawei.

The project was initially inspired by [1] and [2].
